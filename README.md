## 🤝 Collaboration – Build Something Together

If you're working on technology in the generative AI or RAG ecosystem - vector databases, embedding models, web search APIs, orchestration frameworks, observability tools, GPU infrastructure, security layers, or similar - let's partner to create open-source tutorials that showcase real-world implementations. We'll build practical, vendor-neutral notebooks that help developers understand your tool through hands-on examples.

- **Approach** - clean, executable notebooks without paywalls or marketing fluff  
- **Impact** - developers get working examples
